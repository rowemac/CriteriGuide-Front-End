# CriteriGuide

## Description

The CriteriGuide Single Page Application (SPA) acts as a viewer's guide to track a user's real-world interaction with a must-see selection of the Criterion Film Collection. A user may mark a film as watched and/or favorited as well as add individual viewing notes with an entered time stamp for further study or reference. 

**This repo should be used in conjunction with the backend repo link listed below to fully experience the app's functionality.**

Once both servers are up and running a user may modify or add to the backend database from the Rails API as they see fit on their local machine. 


## Install Instructions

- Fork the repo and copy the SSH link.

- `cd` into your desired folder and paste the SSH link into your terminal and hit `enter`.

- Once opened in your preferred text editor, open the terminal and type `npx serve` to fire up the frontend server.

- A link will be provided once the server is fired: http://localhost5000
